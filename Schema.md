# Schema

This file provides documentation on the underlying schema; try to keep it up to date if you make changes.  Note that there is also some additional infrastructure imported from the LMFDB (counts and stats tables, which we don't use; we have a separate knowls database with the same infrastructure).  Except for id (always first), columns are sorted by name (please maintain this).

## Users

Note that we've adapted the LMFDB's model, so we don't use `lmfdb.backend.searchtable.PostgresSearchTable` but rather `lmfdb.users.pwdmanager.PostgresUserTable`.

`users`: data on users (note that this is in the userdb schema rather than public schema)
