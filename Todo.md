Admin (Edgar)
=====

1. Add pages for user management (inviting and approving users, user-add tokens)

1. Add user page for changing info (e.g. homepage, time zone, affiliation)

1. Add institution page for changing info (e.g. homepage, time zone, aliases)

1. Create login page, mechanisms for resetting password

1. Add ability to deal with spam: admins should be able to easily hide a page, which should shut down the editing ability of the user who changed it last

Content creation
================

1. Add pages for creating a seminar and for editing it (overall attributes and adding talks)

1. Add page for speaker/organizer to update the info on a talk

1. Makes sure that content creators can delete things if they want

1. Adapt knowl editing code for content creation and saving.  In particular, this gives us versioning for abstracts.

Viewing and searching
=====================

1. Design and implement front page view, both for logged in and new users

1. Adapt search results pages from LMFDB to viewing seminars and talks

1. Create seminar homepage.  Should it be different for a conference?  Either has the capacity to include a link to an external page.

1. Create talk homepage.  Different versions for when talk is in the future, ongoing, or in the past.

Feedback
========

1. Add avenues for users to give feedback both to admins and to content creators

Calendars
=========

1. Figure out how to personalize calendar files in a way that updates to talks and seminars are included (can't use beantheory's approach which is static)

1. Think about whether google's calendar limits will affect us: https://support.google.com/a/answer/2905486?hl=en

Email
=====

1. The system needs to be able to send emails.  Figure out how to make that work.

Design and branding
===================

1. Clean up css file to remove all the old stuff, think about what we want to have.

1. Come up with a logo and favicon

1. Think of a good name and register it

1. Once we're ready, think about advertising strategy (Bjorn emailing number theory list; how to reach out beyond number theory, posting on Facebook, etc)
