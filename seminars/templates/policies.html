<ul>
  <li>Seminars, conferences, and talks added to this site must be related to research mathematics or mathematics education.</li>
  <li>Events listed publicly on this site should be open to participation by anyone, except that organizers may require registration or otherwise limit participation in order to manage oversubscribed events or to prevent inappropriate disruptions.</li>
  <li>No fee may be charged for online participation in any event listed on this site.  In-person participants may be charged a modest registration fee, but only to cover costs.  Those costs must not include paying a stipend or salary to any of the organizers.</li>

Scientific content
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Abstracts, if included, should briefly summarize what the talk will be about.  An abstract should not be an entire manuscript, but it may include a link to a manuscript.  Preprints belong elsewhere, such as the <a href="https://arxiv.org">arXiv</a> or <a href="https://vixra.org">viXra</a>.</li>
  <li>Talks based on joint research should mention all co-authors in the abstract.</li>
  <li>Content added by users should be accurate, to the best of knowledge of the user.</li>
  <li>Comments unrelated to the scientific content are not allowed anywhere on this site.  For example, venting of grievances is inappropriate here.</li>
