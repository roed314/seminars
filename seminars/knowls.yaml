    Like Wikipedia, mathseminars.org uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Sentence_case">sentence case</a> for seminar names and talk titles:
    only the first word and proper nouns should be capitalized.
seminar_description: 
  title: Short description

topics:
  title: Topics
  contents: |
    You may associate zero or more topics to a talk, seminar, or conference.  Each topic corresponds to an arXiv subject class; for example number theory is <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/math.NT/recent">math.NT</a>.
    New talks inherit the topics of the seminar or conference to which they belong; these can then be modified for a particular talk if desired.
    Changing the topics of a seminar or conference has no impact on existing talks.
language:
  title: Language
  contents: |
    Each talk, seminar, and conference has an associated language (English is the default).
    New talks inherit the language of the seminar or conference to which they belong; this can then be modified for a particular talk if desired.
    Changing the language of a seminar or conference has no impact on existing talks.
weekday:
  title: Meeting day
  contents: |
    Set this if your seminar meets on a particular day of the week, even if your seminar does not meet every week.
    If specified, this value will be used to layout the grid used editing the schedule of talks for your seminar.
    <br><br>
    For seminars that meet more than one day per week we suggest either setting the meeting day to the first day of the week your seminar meets and then editing the dates on the scheduling grid,
    or not setting the meeting day and setting the frequency to 1, which will give you a scheulding grid with slots for each day.
    We are currently working on features to better support seminars that meet on multiple days.
frequency:
  title: Frequency
  contents: |
    Specify the frequency of your seminar if it meets at regular intervals, every 7 or 14 days, for example.
    If your seminar does not meet on a particular day of the week you can set the frequency to 1; this will yielda scheduling grid with slots for each day.
per_day:
  title: Talks per day
  contents: |
    The number of talks you expect to take place each day your seminar or conference meets.
    This is used only to determine the number of slots to create in your scheduling grid; you can still add more talks on a particular day if you wish.
start_date:
  title: Start date
  contents: |
    The date on which your conference begins.
end_date:
  title: End date
  contents: |
    The date on which your conference ends.
seminar_start_time:
  title: Start time
  contents: |
    The time of day your seminar usually meets, specified in 24 hour format (so 4 or 4:00 is 4AM; use 16:00 for 4PM).
seminar_end_time:
  title: End time
  contents: |
    The time of day your seminar usually ends, specified in 24 hour format (so 4 or 4:00 is 4AM; use 16:00 for 4PM).
timezone:
  title: Timezone
  contents: |
    Each talk, seminar, and conference has a timezone that determines how dates and times associated to the event are interpreted.
    Even if your event has no particular physical location, you must set the timezone so that we know how to interperet dates and times that you input.
    Note that a timezone is in general not the same as a UTC offset, it takes adjustments for daylight savings time into account,
    but you can choose UTC as your timezone if you wish.
    <br><br>
    Dates and times shown to visitors of mathseminars.org are translated into their local timezone, as specified in their user account or on their computer.
    This includes organizers, so when editing a schedule the timezone of the seminar or conference will be used to interpret your inputs, but when browsing talks
    your local timezone will be used.
room:
  title: Room
  contents: |
    The physical location of a talk, seminar, or conference; leave this blank for events that take place solely online.
    New talks inherit the room of the seminar or conference to which they belong; this can then be modified for a particular talk if desired.
    Note that changing the room of a seminar or conference has no impact on talks that have already been created.
    <br><br>
    Use the comments to provide any specific instructions to help visitors find the room (you can include a link to a campus map, for example).
online:
  title: Online
  contents: |
    If your seminar can be attended online, indicate that here.  Seminars that provide a livestream of a meeting taking place in a physical location should
    set the location in the Room property and set the online option to yes.
live_link:
  title: Livestream link
  contents: |
    Events taking place online should list the URL of the livestream here.
    For seminars and conferences, if the livestream link is not the same for each talk, put "see comments" here and explain in the comments how to get
    the livestream link for each talk.
    New talks inherit the livestream link of the seminar or conference to which they belong; this can then be modified for a particular talk if desired.
    <br><br>
    If your livestream requires a password you should indicate in the comments how participants should obtain the password.
access:
  title: Access
  contents: |
    For talks, seminars, and conferences with a livestream link this determines whether the link will be shown to
    everyone who visits mathseminars.org, only to users who are logged in to an account on mathseminars.org, or only to endorsed users of mathseminars.org.
    If the livestream link is not specified this setting is ignored.
comments:
  title: Comments
  contents: |
    Use the comments field to add additional information about yout talk, seminar, or conferenee, especially details on how
    to find the room or access the live link.  You can use include links to external pages here.  Any token beginning with
    "http://" or "https://" will automatically appear as a link and you can also use HTML hyperlinks.
    <br><br>
    When a talk is displayed the comments for both the talk and the seminar are displayed; there is no need to repeat information.
    Use the seminar comments for information applicable to every talk and use the talk comments for information specific to that talk.

email:
  title: Email
