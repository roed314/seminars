topics:
  title: Topics
  contents: |
    You may associate zero or more topics to a series or talk.
    Each topic corresponds to an arXiv subject class;
    for example, <i>number theory</i> corresponds to <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/math.NT/recent">math.NT</a>.

weekday:
  title: Meeting day
  contents: |
    Set this if your series meets on a particular day of the week, even if your series does not meet every week.
    If set, this value will be used to lay out the grid used when editing your series' talk schedule.
    <br><br>
    For series that meet more than one day per week,
    we suggest either setting the meeting day to the first day of the week your series meets
    and then editing the dates on the scheduling grid,
    or not setting the meeting day and setting the frequency to 1,
    which will give you a scheduling grid with slots for each day.
    We are currently working to better support series that meet on multiple days.
frequency:
  title: Frequency
  contents: |
    Specify the frequency of your series if it meets at regular intervals, every 7 or 14 days, for example.
    If your series does not meet on a particular day of the week, set the frequency to 1;
    this will yield a scheduling grid with slots for each day.
per_day:
  title: Talks per day
  contents: |
    The number of talks you expect to take place each day your series meets.
    This is used only to determine the number of slots to create in your scheduling grid;

    The information entered here is used only to configure the initial layout of the scheduling grid and can be changed as needed.
timezone:
  title: Timezone
  contents: |
    Each talk and series has a time zone
    that determines how dates and times associated to the event are interpreted.
    Even if your event has no particular physical location, you must set the time zone.

    Each organizer name displayed on the series' page will be a link to this URL.

    If you have co-authors, it is better to mention them not here,

    The links labelled <i>Google Calendar</i> or <i>iCal/Outlook</i> allow you to export your favorite series and talks to your chosen calendar app.  Later, if talks are added to those series, your calendar will automatically be updated.<br><br>  Some calendar services sync external calendars only every <a href="https://kb.mit.edu/confluence/display/istcontrib/How+to+change+the+update+frequency+of+a+calendar+I+am+subscribing+to">24 hours</a>. Furthermore, some may take even longer for the initial sync. A workaround is to copy the URL of the <i>ICS file</i> link and add it manually to your calendar app.
filter:
  title: Filter
  contents: |
    <p>Each filter restricts the talk list,
    and the talks displayed are those in the <i>intersection</i> of the subsets defined by the activated filters.</p>
    <p>Start by clicking the word <u>subject</u> above, which sets the subject filter and opens the subject menu.
    Initially no subjects are selected, so the activation of the subject filter means that no talks are displayed,
    but each time you click on a subject to add it, talks in that subject will appear.
    Click <u>subject</u> again to close the subject menu.
    Toggling the subject filter off and on now switches between displaying all talks vs. only talks in your selected subjects.</p>
    <p>Next click <u>topic</u> to restrict to selected topics within each subject,
    and click <u>language</u> to restrict to talks in the languages you understand.
    If all the filters are turned on, then a talk must satisfy all the criteria in order to be displayed.</p>
    <p><i>Example:</i> Suppose that the subject filter is activated and physics is not a selected subject.
      If you open the topics menu and select optics (a topic within physics), then no optics talks will appear,
      because the subject filter is hiding <i>all</i> physics talks.</p>
