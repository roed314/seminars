    Choose <i>seminar series</i> for a recurring series of talks spread out over weeks.
    Choose <i>conference</i> for an event lasting a few days with talks each day.
    Our site treats seminar series and conferences identically for the most part; 
    the main difference is the layout when editing the talk schedule.

    for titles: 
    only the first word and proper nouns should be capitalized.
seminar_description:
  title: Short description
  contents: |
    A short desciption of your series that will be displayed in our search pages 
    along with the name and institutions.

    The list of institutions can be changed at any time.
topics:
  title: Topics
  contents: |
    You may associate zero or more topics to a series or talk.  
    Each topic corresponds to an arXiv subject class; 
    for example, <i>number theory</i> corresponds to <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/math.NT/recent">math.NT</a>.
    New talks inherit the topics of the series to which they belong; 
    these can then be modified for a particular talk if desired.
    Changing the topics of a series has no impact on existing talks.
language:
  title: Language
  contents: |
    Each series and talk has an associated language.
    New talks inherit the language of the series to which they belong;

weekday:
  title: Meeting day
  contents: |
    Set this if your series meets on a particular day of the week, even if your series does not meet every week.
    If set, this value will be used to lay out the grid used when editing your series' talk schedule.
    <br><br>
    For series that meet more than one day per week, 
    we suggest either setting the meeting day to the first day of the week your series meets 
    and then editing the dates on the scheduling grid,
    or not setting the meeting day and setting the frequency to 1, 
    which will give you a scheduling grid with slots for each day.
    We are currently working to better support series that meet on multiple days.
frequency:
  title: Frequency
  contents: |
    Specify the frequency of your series if it meets at regular intervals, every 7 or 14 days, for example.
    If your series does not meet on a particular day of the week, set the frequency to 1; 
    this will yield a scheduling grid with slots for each day.
per_day:
  title: Talks per day
  contents: |
    The number of talks you expect to take place each day your series meets.
    This is used only to determine the number of slots to create in your scheduling grid; 
    you can still add more talks on any particular day.

    For example 11:30-13:00 indicates a talk that runs from 11:30 A.M. to 1 P.M.
    Note that you can still create talks in your series at irregular times;
    this information is used only to configure the initial layout of the scheduling grid.
timezone:
  title: Timezone
  contents: |
    Each talk and series has a time zone 
    that determines how dates and times associated to the event are interpreted.
    Even if your event has no particular physical location, you must set the time zone.
    <i>Warning:</i> Different time zones with 
    the same current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC</a> offset 
    may switch to daylight saving time on different dates, so choose the precise time zone, 
    not just one with the correct UTC offset.

    <br><br>
    Dates and times are displayed to site visitors in their local time zone,

    Changing the room of a series has no impact on previously created talks.
    <br><br>
    Instructions to help visitors find the room should be entered in the Comments box (you can include a link to a campus map, for example).

    New talks inherit the livestream link of the seminar or conference to which they belong; 
    this can then be modified for a particular talk if desired.
