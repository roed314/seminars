  title: Type
  contents: |
    Seminars are best used for series of talks that recur at more or less regular intervals (every Tuesday and Thursday, or every other Wednesday for example).
    Conferences are events with a fixed start and end date (usually a more or less consecutive sequence of days with some number of talks per day).
    For the most part seminars and conferences are treated identically on our site, the main difference is in how the grid for the talk schedule is layed out.
shortname:
  title: Identifier

    The identifier of the seminar (or conference) is a string of up to 32 characters that will be included in all URL links to the seminar and talks that take place in it.
    It must consist of letters (case sensitive), numbers, hypens and undersores, with no spaces.
